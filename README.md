# Potentiometer Variable Resistor

#### Project Overview

The Potentiometer Variable Resistor project demonstrates how to use an Arduino Nano to read analog input from a potentiometer (variable resistor) and map the analog values to a desired range. Potentiometers are widely used in electronics to provide variable resistance and are commonly found in volume controls, dimmer switches, and other user interface elements.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **Potentiometer**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Potentiometer to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect one end of the potentiometer to 5V on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the other end of the potentiometer to GND on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the wiper (middle pin) of the potentiometer to analog pin A0 on the Arduino Nano.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the potentiometer to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, open the serial monitor.
   - The serial monitor will display the mapped potentiometer value, which corresponds to the position of the potentiometer knob.

#### Applications

- **Analog Input Control:** Use potentiometers to control parameters such as volume, brightness, and speed in various electronic projects.
- **User Interface:** Implement potentiometers as user interface elements for adjusting settings and parameters in devices.
- **Analog Sensor Interface:** Convert analog sensor inputs to digital values suitable for processing by microcontrollers.

#### Notes

- Adjust the delay in the code to control the rate at which the potentiometer value is read and displayed.
- Experiment with different mapping ranges to suit the specific requirements of your project.
- Potentiometers can be combined with other components like LEDs, motors, and displays to create interactive and responsive systems.
